# Functions in Python
- type()

## Introduction to Python

### Fundamentally performs `calculations`
-- build-in calculations to the language
-- We will define new calculations

### Remembers results `storing`

### Type of knowledge
- Declarative knowledge
-- statement of fact: `x is y such that y*y =x`
- Imperative knowledge
-- recipe the `how to` --> Algorithms
Algorithms: 1. steps , 2. flow of control, and 3. when to stop.

### Computer are machines
- Fixed program
-- Calculator
-- Alan Turing's Bombe

- Stored program
-- Computer

#### Basic Machine Architecture
- Memory
  Store data
- Arithmetic Logic Unit
  do primitive ops
- Control Unit
  program counter
- INput
- OUTput

## Languages
- primitive constructs numbers strings operations
- Syntax Static semantics Syntactic errors Static semantic errors
- Different meaning than what programmer intended
- Determines whether a string is legal: Syntax
- Determines whether a string has meaning: Static semantics
- Assigns a meaning to a legal sentence: Semantic


## Python programs TYPES
- Evaluate and execute by interpreter shell
- Commands are statements
- Objects (fundamentals)
    - Data Objects
    - Every objects have a `Type`
- Scalar Objects
    - int:integers
    - float:real numbers
    - bool:true False
    - NoneType: Has no value, `None`
    - Scalar
- Expressions
  - Combine objects and operators forms an expression
- Simple Operations
  - Operator precedence
    - `**`
    - `*`
    - `/`
    - `+ and -`
    Executed left to right

## Operators and Branching
- Comparison operators on `int` and `float`
  - `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`
- Logic operators on `bools`
  -`not`, `and`, `or`
## Iteration and recursion

## Variables --> Abstraction (assignment)
- Binding variables and values `assignment using =`
  - Value stored in computer  memory
  - Also called `name table`
  - Reuse names instead values
  - Easier to change code later


## Organize and modularize

## Different classes  Algorithms

## Complexity of Algorithms
